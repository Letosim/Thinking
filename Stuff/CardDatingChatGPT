Ah, you're brainstorming an IRL dating system with a bit of flair! A hybrid of real-world interaction and structured matchmaking sounds intriguing. Let me help you refine this idea.
The Concept: App Windows or Pass Cards

Imagine a system where participants wear visible "dating profiles" like app windows or badges clipped to their attire, combining the utility of online apps with the immediacy of face-to-face interaction.
How It Could Work

    Pass Card Design:
        Each participant gets a personalized card that showcases:
            Name (or pseudonym, for privacy).
            A quick "About Me" (think Tinder bio, but IRL).
            Fun icons or tags for interests (books, gaming, coffee, hiking).
            A QR code linking to their full online profile (for the tech-savvy).
        Cards could be color-coded based on preferences (e.g., introvert-friendly, open to new friends, looking for long-term relationships).

    Clip-on or Badge Style:
        Participants clip their card to a lanyard, vest, or shirt. This makes it easy for others to spot and interact.
        Could have a detachable/flip-down option for privacy when not actively engaging.

    Interactive Features:
        Conversation Starter Tabs: Flap-like tabs with pre-set icebreakers ("Ask me about my favorite movie!" or "Tell me your most unusual hobby").
        Mood Indicator Dial: A small, adjustable dial showing if you're open to talking, busy, or just observing.

Event Integration

This system could work exceptionally well at events, like:

    Dating Meetups: Everyone wears their cards, facilitating quick introductions and matches.
    Speed Dating: Participants switch seats but use their visible profiles for a faster vibe check.
    Social Mixers: Cards could be tailored for networking or just casual mingling.

For the Tech-Inclined

    Integrate NFC Chips: Tap the card with a phone to exchange contact details instantly.
    Pair with an App: The app could track who you met, let you "match" after the event, and provide a low-pressure way to continue the conversation.

Why It Works

    Visibility: Removes the ambiguity of who's open to talking.
    Conversation Starters: Helps even the shyest participants engage.
    Fun and Non-Digital: Adds a playful, human element missing from dating apps.
    Scalable: Great for intimate gatherings or large conventions.

So, would you go sleek and minimalist, or quirky and fun with the design?

dont know some sort of gryeish blue with a hint of red for the backgground or would this be to much of Shōji Yamashiro

Ah, a greyish-blue with a hint of red—a bold and moody choice, like an 80s sci-fi synthwave cover but subtly restrained. Definitely gives off Shōji Yamashiro vibes (a little Akira soundtrack-esque, right?), though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. It depends on the tone you’re going for with the system.
When Greyish-Blue with Red Works

    Evocative and Modern: Creates a futuristic yet approachable feel, especially if the greyish-blue dominates and the red is used sparingly as accents (like highlights or borders).
    Subtle Drama: Gives off a mysterious, slightly tech-inspired energy that says “I’m intriguing, but not too much drama.”
    Contrast: Red naturally draws attention, so it could make key elements pop, like names, icons, or tags on the pass cards.

When It Might Be Too Much

    If overdone, it could lean too dystopian or edgy, which might intimidate participants rather than invite them to connect.
    If the red is too aggressive (think large patches or bright neon), it might feel overwhelming rather than complementary.

Design Tips for Balance

    Base Colors:
    Use greyish-blue as the dominant color for the background or main card design. It’s soft, calming, and professional.

    Red as an Accent:
    Apply red sparingly:
        Borders or underlines for emphasis.
        Interactive elements (e.g., mood indicators or QR codes).
        Highlighting your "most intriguing" features or interests.

    Typography:
    Use white or off-white for text to maintain readability, especially against darker greyish-blue tones.

    Texture/Style:
    A slight gradient or texture in the greyish-blue (think brushed steel or subtle linen patterns) could add depth without overpowering.

Shōji Yamashiro Adjacent, but Not Overkill

To keep the "Yamashiro aesthetic" from taking over:

    Avoid heavy use of glowing/neon effects or stark contrasts.
    Keep red accents small and purposeful, not splattered everywhere like a cyberpunk fever dream.
    If you're inspired by his vibe, maybe add minimalist geometric shapes (circles, lines, grids) in the design as a nod to his style without full immersion.

This palette could totally work for your system! It’s a blend of approachable and memorable—striking, but not screaming.
