So what about some soft epilepsy test

Where a person sits in front of a "microscope" like device. The person are shown two images some neutral living space and then the second photo is replaced by the same image taken small Intervalls laters?!?!?!?!?

The test you described seems to be a form of visual evoked potential (VEP) test, specifically designed to monitor brain responses to visual stimuli. Here's a breakdown of how this might work:

Concept

1. Microscope-like Device: This device would allow precise monitoring of visual stimuli and brain response.


2. Images Shown: The person is shown two imagesâ€”initially, a neutral, static image (e.g., a living space) that doesn't provoke significant brain activity.


3. Temporal Variations: The second image is then replaced by the same image, but taken at small intervals later (e.g., every few seconds). These variations could capture slight changes in the image, testing the brain's response to dynamic stimuli.


4. Epilepsy Test: By observing the changes in visual evoked potentials (VEPs) or brainwave patterns, doctors could detect abnormalities in brain function that might relate to epilepsy.



This type of test could be useful for diagnosing epilepsy, especially if visual changes in the brain precede a seizure. It essentially tracks how the brain processes visual information over time, which can be crucial in detecting subtle issues in brain function.
